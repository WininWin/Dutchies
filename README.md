# server-fp-cs498rk
final project for cs498rk, implementing a web dutch auction system through a MEAN stack web app
<br>
This repo contains the code for the backend/server side.

You should be able to do
`npm install` and `nodemon -L server.js`

Nodemon does auto-reloading the same way grunt does on the frontend.

You might have to install nodemon on the vagrant machine using
`npm install -g nodemon`
