final project for cs498rk, implementing a web dutch auction system through a MEAN stack web app
<br>
This repo contains the code for the backend/server side.

You should be able to do
`npm install` and `nodemon -L server.js`

Nodemon does auto-reloading the same way grunt does on the frontend. This will also serve the client code if you have the repo cloned into the same parent directory as the server repo. Run ```grunt``` in another window to refresh both the back end and the front end automatically when you make changes.

You might have to install nodemon on the vagrant machine using
`npm install -g nodemon`
